# Source code
Each folder is a project with source code for individual app

These folders within each project have the main code to create the apps.

These projects may not have all the folders.

They have only the most important folders which are used for building apps

These projects may only have folders such as:-

    lib
    assets   
    pubspec.yaml
    res(android)

When building these projects just make a sample program and then replace the default folders with provided folders and run it.

You will get the same results.
